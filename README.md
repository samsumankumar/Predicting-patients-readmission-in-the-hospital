# Predicting-patients-readmission-in-the-hospital

There are two files where the the first file is of prediction where I did not use diagnoses codes and other the file is with Diagnoses codes.

I have used the Real time hospital data of patients which is really messy with 26 tables. It has been accessed by completing a certificaion under CITI group. The dataset is 
named as MIMIC III data.
